# Single-Cycle-Microprocessor
MIPS 8-bit processor
This project implemented an 8-bit processor based on the MIPS architecture in Verilog; 
programmed and tested on the Altera DE2 FPGA board 
Project design involved emulating a heart rate monitor; 
later created a MIPS instruction set to observe LED level changes in heart rate.
